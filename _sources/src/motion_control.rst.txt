Motion Control
==============
Motion control is a key aspect of robotic functionality,
allowing precise movement based on predetermined references
within the robot’s local coordinate system. This involves generating linear and angular velocity references, which are then
translated into specific wheel velocities via inverse kinematics.
The controller board receives these velocity references to
control the wheel’s motion, with feedback on actual velocities
provided by the wheel encoders. This feedback is crucial
for odometry, which employs forward kinematics to convert
wheel velocities back into robot frame velocities for accurate
positioning.

The figure below illustrates how this is implemented in ROS 2.

Motion Reference
----------------
UiAbot’s motion is guided by linear
and angular velocity references, specified in the robot’s local
coordinate frame. These references are generated by publishing `geometry_msgs/Twist <http://docs.ros.org/en/noetic/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/Twist.html>`_ message to the ``/cmd_vel`` topic.

The figure above shows this by using the built-in ``teleop_twist_keyboard`` node, that converts keyboard input to linear and angular velocity. Another solution would be to create a node that generates a trajectory and publishes a `geometry_msgs/Twist <http://docs.ros.org/en/noetic/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/Twist.html>`_ message to the ``/cmd_vel`` topic.

.. _motion_control inverse_kinematics:

Inverse Kinematics
------------------
To translate the desired motion
from the robot’s coordinate frame into wheel-specific velocity
commands, inverse kinematics is used. The kinematic model
considers the robot’s geometry, particularly how linear and
angular velocities correlate with wheel rotations, as shown in
the figure below.

    Figure: Definition of the robot’s local coordinate system for kinematic analysis.

Each wheel has the linear velocities :math:`\dot{x_r}` and :math:`\dot{x_l}`, corresponding to right and left wheels, respectively. As shown in the figure below, the wheel angular velocity is denoted by :math:`\dot{\phi}`, and wheel radius by :math:`r`.

.. figure:: fig/kinematics/wheel_figure.svg
    :width: 250
    :align: center 

    Figure: Wheel definition.

The linear velocities for the wheels can be written as.

.. math::
   \dot{x}_{r} = \dot{\phi}_{r}r \\
   \dot{x}_{l} = \dot{\phi}_{l}r
   :label: linear_vel_wheel

| **Considering pure translational velocity**
| We first consider that the robot has pure translational velocity. Since we are looking at the robot in the local coordinate frame, the linear velocity is composed of a velocities along the x- and y-axis. However, assuming zero slip, which means :math:`\dot{y}=0`. The linear velocity is only :math:`\dot{x}`. For the robot to have pure translation velocity, both wheels will need to have the same angular velocities. This yields the following equation.

.. math::
    \begin{align}
        \dot{x}_{r} = \dot{x}_{l} = \dot{x} \\
        \Rightarrow \dot{\phi}_{r}r = \dot{\phi}_{l}r = \dot{x} \\
        \Rightarrow \dot{\phi}_{r} = \dot{\phi}_{l} = \frac{\dot{x}}{r}
    \end{align}
    :label: trans_vel

| **Considering pure angular velocity**
| We then consider that the robot has pure rotational velocity. The robot rotational velocity is denoted as :math:`\dot{\theta}`. For the robot to have pure rotational velocity, the wheels will need to have opposite angular velocites.

.. math::
    \dot{\phi}_{r} = -\dot{\phi}_{l}
    :label: rot_vel_opposite

Assuming no lateral movement, the wheels must follow a circle, which yields the following equations for the right :eq:`rot_vel_r` and left wheel :eq:`rot_vel_l`.

.. math::
    \dot{\phi}_{r}r = \frac{L}{2}\dot{\theta} \Rightarrow \dot{\phi}_{r} = \frac{L}{2}\frac{\dot{\theta}}{r}
    :label: rot_vel_r

.. math::
    \dot{\phi}_{l}r = -\frac{L}{2}\dot{\theta} \Rightarrow \dot{\phi}_{l} = -\frac{L}{2}\frac{\dot{\theta}}{r}
    :label: rot_vel_l

| **Combining the velocities**
| Since both the definintion of the linear :eq:`r_wheel` and angular velocites are valid in vector-space, these can be added together for the right and left wheel in equation :eq:`r_wheel` and :eq:`l_wheel`. This yields expressions for the wheel angular velocities, :math:`\dot{\phi}_r` and :math:`\dot{\phi}_l`, given the linear and angular robot velocites, :math:`\dot{x}` and :math:`\dot{\theta}`.

.. math::
    \dot{\phi}_{r} = \frac{\dot{x}}{r} + \frac{L}{2}\frac{\dot{\theta}}{r}
    :label: r_wheel

.. math::
    \dot{\phi}_{l} = \frac{\dot{x}}{r} - \frac{L}{2}\frac{\dot{\theta}}{r}
    :label: l_wheel

The inverse kinematics can then be written in matrix form as.

.. math:: 
    \begin{bmatrix}\dot{\phi}_r \\ \dot{\phi}_l \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{r} \begin{bmatrix}1 & \frac{L}{2} \\ 1 & -\frac{L}{2}  \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}\dot{x} \\ \dot{\theta}\end{bmatrix}
    :label: inverse_kinematics

The inverse kinematics of the robot is implemented in the :ref:`uiabot_pkg control` node.

.. _motion_control forward_kinematics:

Forward Kinematics
------------------

The forward kinematics is used to transform wheel angular velocities, :math:`\dot{\phi}_r` and :math:`\dot{\phi}_l`, to robot angular and linear velocities, :math:`\dot{x}` and :math:`\dot{\theta}`, given in the local coordinate frame. Based on equation :eq:`inverse_kinematics` from the inverse kinematics, we can solve for :math:`\dot{x}` and :math:`\dot{\theta}`. Which gives the following equation.

.. math::
    \begin{bmatrix}\dot{x} \\ \dot{\theta}\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}\frac{r}{2} & \frac{r}{2} \\ \frac{L}{2} & -\frac{L}{2}\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}\dot{\phi}_r \\ \dot{\phi}_l \end{bmatrix}
    :label: forward_kinematics

The forward kinematics of the robot is implemented in the :ref:`uiabot_pkg mechanical_odometry` node.

Motor Controller
----------------
On the uiabot, the motors are driven by a ODrive controller board, which is connected to the Jetson Nano through USB. To make the ODrive available on the ROS 2 network, an interface node is created: :ref:`odrive_ros2_pkg odrive_ros2`. This node makes it possible to publish velocity references to each wheel.
