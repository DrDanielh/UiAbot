Project Description
===================

This is the main documentation for the project in MAS514 at the University of Agder (UiA). In which the goal is to drive a mobile robot autonomously using the ROS 2 robotics framework. The course gives a brief introduction to several topics related to robotics and instrumentation, including motion control, perception, localization and mapping, and motion planning and navigation.

Each group is given a differential drive robot, called UiAbot, inspired by `turtlebot <https://www.turtlebot.com/>`_. The UiAbot is equipped with sensors such as wheel encoders, a LiDAR, and an IMU. A Jetson Nano with Ubuntu 20.04 is used for sensor data processing and control.  

*Project by*: Martin MÃ¦land, Tarjei Skotterud, and Martin Dahlseng Hermansen
